A 3-month personal expense analysis to identify spending trends and saving opportunities.
# Project : Personal Expense & Savings Analysis

## 1. Project Objective (Initiation)
The goal of this project was to analyze 3 months of transaction data to identify "spending leaks" and find a way to save $100 per month.

## 2. Process (Execution)
- **Data Cleaning:** Categorized messy descriptions (e.g., "Starbucks") into clean categories ("Dining Out").
- **Analysis:** Built a Pivot Table to sum expenses by category.

## 3. Data Insights (Storytelling)

- **Action Plan:** By cutting Starbucks trips in half, I can save $71.75 monthly, reaching 70% of my savings goal without moving house or changing my lifestyle.

## 4. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of data categorization. By turning 30 random rows of data into a visual story, I found a clear path to financial savings.
